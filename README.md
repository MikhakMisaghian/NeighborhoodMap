# NeighborhoodMap
You can run this app here:

-------------------------------------------------
Short Summary:

- This app display some of my favorite places in San Francisco, CA.
- This app displays markers on the map for each place in my model.
- It also shows a list of my favorite places with a search box on top.
- User can search for a place from my list, then the list-view will only display the search result on the list-view and also for markers on the map.
- When user clicks on a marker, an infowindow will open and shows the place name and address.
- I get the place address using forsquare api.
- When user clicks on a place in my list-view, it centers the map and the marker for that place will bounce.
- In mobile view, the list-view height will be smaller and user can scroll in the list-view so that it won't take up the whole screen.
